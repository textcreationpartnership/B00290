            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was neuer any thyng by the wyt of man ſo well deuyſed, or ſo ſure eſtablyſſhed, (whyche in contynuaunce of tyme) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thynges) it may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers in the Churche, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called deuine ſeruice. The firſt originall and grounde whereof, if a man would ſearche oute by the auncyente fathers, he ſhall fynde that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame was not ordained but of a good purpoſe, and for a greate aduauncement of godlynes. For they ſo ordred the matter, that all the whole Byble, (or the greateſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) ſhould be read ouer once in the yere: ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng therby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Cleargie, and ſpeciallye ſuche as were miniſters of the congregacyon, ſhoulde (by often readyng and meditacyon of Goddes worde) be ſtyrred vp to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes themſelues, and be more hable alſo to exhorte other by wholeſome doctryne, and to confute them that wer aduerſaries to the truth. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the people (by dayly hearing of holy ſcrypture read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church) ſhould contynually profyt more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more enflamed with the loue of hys true religyon. But theſe many yeres paſſed, this godly and decente ordre of the auncyente fathers, hath been ſo altered, broken, and neglected, by plantyng in vncertayne Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, Legendes, Reſpondes, Verſes, vayne Repeticions, Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, &amp; Sinodalles, that commonly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any boke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible was begon, before three or foure Chapters were read out, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt were vnread. And in thys ſorte the boke of Eſai was begonne in Aduent, and the booke of Geneſis in Septuageſima: but they were only begonne, and neuer read throughe. After a lyke ſorte were other bokes of holy ſcripture vſed. And moreouer, wheras Sainct Paul would haue ſuch language ſpoken to the people in the Churche, as they myghte vnderſtande, and haue profyt by hearyng the ſame: The ſeruice in thys Churche of Englande (theſe many yeres) haue been read in Latine to the people, which they vnderſtode not: ſo that they haue heard with their eares onely, and theyr heartes, ſpirite and mynde, haue not been edifyed thereby. And furthermore, notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng that the auncyente fathers haue deuyded the Pſalmes into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen porcyons, wherof euery one was called a Nocturne: now of late time a fewe of them haue been dayly ſayd, and oft repeated, and the reſt vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omytted. Moreouer, the noumbre and hardnes of the rules, called the Pye, and the manyfolde chaungeinges of the ſeruyce, was the cauſe, that to turne the booke onely, was ſo hard and intricate a matter, that manye tymes there was more buſynes to fynde out what ſhould be read, then to reade it when it was founde out.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inconueniences therefore conſydered, here is ſet furth ſuche an ordre, whereby the ſame ſhalbee redreſſed. And for a readineſſe in thys matter, here is drawen out a Kalender for that purpoſe, whych is playne
<pb facs="tcp:180822:3"/> and eaſy to be vnderſtanden, wherin (ſo muche as may be) the reading of holy ſcriptures is ſo ſet furth, that all thynges ſhalbe done in ordre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking one piece therof from an other. For this cauſe be cut of, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes, Reſpondes, Inuitatories, and ſuche lyke thynges, as did breake the continuall courſe of the reading of the ſcripture. Yet becauſe there is no remedie, but that of neceſſitie there muſt be ſome rules: therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne rules are here ſet furthe, whiche as they be few in numbre, ſo they be playne and eaſy to bee vnderſtanden. So that here you haue an ordre for prayer (as touching the reading of holye ſcripture) muche agreable to the mynde and purpoſe of tholde fathers, and a greate deale more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and commodious, then that which of late was vſed. It is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, becauſe here are left out many thynges, whereof ſome be vntrue, ſome vncertayne, ſome vayne and ſuperſticious, and is ordeined nothing to be read, but the very pure woorde of God, the holye ſcriptures, or that whiche is euidentlye grounded vpon the ſame: and that in ſuche a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ordre, as is moſt eaſy and playne for the vnderſtandyng, both of the readers and hearers. It is alſo more commodious, bothe for the ſhortnes thereof, and for the playnnes of the ordre, and for that the rules be few and eaſy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the Curates ſhall nede none other bookes for theyr publyque ſeruice, but thys booke and the Byble: By the meanes whereof, the people ſhall not bee at ſo greate charge for bookes, as in tymes paſt they haue been.</p>
                  <p>And where heretofore there hath been greate diuerſitie in ſaying and ſynging in churches within this realme, ſome folowyng Saliſbury vſe, ſome Herforde vſe, ſome the vſe of Bangor, ſome of Yorke, and ſome of Lincolne: Now from hence foorthe, all the whole Realme ſhall haue but one vſe. And yf any would iudge thys waye more paynfull, becauſe that all thinges muſt be read vpon the booke, whereas before by the reaſon of ſo often repeticion, they could ſaye many thynges by hearte: If thoſe men will weigh their labour, with the profite and knowledge whiche daylye they ſhall obteyne by readyng vpon the booke, they wyll not refuſe the payne, in conſideracion of the great profite that ſhall enſue thereof.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuche as nothyng can almoſt bee ſo playnely ſette foorthe, but doubtes may ryſe in the vſe and practiſyng of the ſame: To appeaſe all ſuche diuerſitie (if any aryſe) and for the reſolucion of al doubtes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the maner howe to vnderſtande, dooe and execute the thynges conteyned in this booke: The parties that ſo doubte, or diuerſlye take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thyng, ſhall alwaye reſorte to the Byſſhoppe of the Dyoceſſe, who by hys dyſcrecion ſhall take ordre for the quieting and appeaſyng of the ſame, ſo that the ſame order bee not contrary to anye thyng conteyned in thys booke. And yf the Byſſhoppe of the Dyoceſſe be in anye doubte, then may he ſende for the reſolucion thereof vnto the Archebiſhoppe.</p>

                  <p>Though it be appoynted in the aforewritten Preface, that all thynges ſhalbe read and ſong in the Churche, in the Englyſhe tongue, to the ende that the congregacion may be thereby edy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: yet it is not mente, but when men ſay Morning and Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer priuately, they may ſay the ſame in any language

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F ſuch Ceremonies as be vſed in the Churche, and haue had their beginning by the inſtitucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſome at the firſt were of godly entent and purpoſe deuyſed, and yet at length turned to vanitie and ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſome entred into the churche by vndiſcrete deuocion, and ſuch a zele as was without knowledge: and forbecuſe they were win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at in the beginning, they grewe dayly to more and more abuſes: which not onely for theyr vnprofitablenes, but alſo becauſe they haue much blynded the people, and obſcured the glory of god, are worthy to be cut awaye &amp; cleane reiected. Other there be, whyche although they haue been deuiſed by man, yet it is thought good to reſerue them ſtyll, aſwel for a decent ordre in the Churhe (for the whiche they were fyrſte deuiſed) as becauſe they parteine to edificacion: whereunto all thynges done in the Churche (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the kepyng or omittyng of a Ceremonie (in it ſelfe conſydered) is but a ſmall thyng: yet the wilful and contempteous tranſgreſſion and breaking of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ordre &amp; diſcipline, is no ſmall offence before god.</p>
                  <p>Let all thynges bee done emong you (ſaieth S. Paul) in a ſemely and due ordre. The appointment of the whiche ordre parteineth not to priuate men: therfore no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to take in hande, nor preſume to appoynte or alter any publyke or common ordre in Chriſtes churche, except he be lawfullye called and aucthorized thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And whereas in thys oure tyme, the myndes of men are ſo diuerſe, that ſome thinke it a great matter of conſcience to depart from a piece of the leaſt of their Ceremonies (they be ſo addicted to their olde cuſtomes:) and agayne on the other ſyde, ſome bee ſo newe fangled, that they would innouate all thyng, and ſo doe deſpyſe thold, that nothyng can lyke
<pb facs="tcp:180822:4"/> them, but that is newe: it was thoughte expediente, not ſo muche to haue reſpecte howe to pleaſe and ſatiſfie eyther of theſe parties, as how to pleaſe god, and profite them both. And yet leſt any man ſhould be offended (whom good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſatiſfie) here be certayne cauſes rendred, why ſome of the accuſtomed Ceremonies be put away, and ſome retained and kept ſtyll.</p>
                  <p>Some are put away, becauſe the great exceſſe &amp; multitude of them hath ſo encreaſed in theſe latter dayes, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of them was intollerable: wherof S. Auguſtyne in hys tyme complayned, that they were growen to ſuche a noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, that the ſtate of Chriſtian people was in worſe caſe (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter) then were the Iewes. And he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that ſuch yoke and burthen ſhould be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, as time waould ſerue quietly to doe it.</p>
                  <p>But what would S. Auguſtyne haue ſaid, yf he had ſeen the Ceremonies of late dayes vſed emong vs; whereunto the multitude vſed in his time, was not to be compared. This our exceſſiue multitude of Ceremonies was ſo great, and many of them ſo darke, that they did more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founde and darken, then declare &amp; ſet forth Chiriſtes benefites vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>And beſides this, Chriſtes goſpel is not a Ceremonial law (as much of Moſes law was) but it is a religion to ſerue God, not in bondage of the figure or ſhadow, but in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpirite, being contente onely with thoſe Ceremonies, which doe ſerue to a decent ordre and godly diſcipline, and ſuch as be apte to ſtirre vp the dul mind of man to the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of his duetie to god, by ſome notable and ſpecial ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificacion, whereby he myght be edified.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the moſte weyghtie cauſe of thaboliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certayn Ceremonies was, that they were ſo farre abuſed, partely by the ſuperſticious blyndneſſe of the rude and vnlearned, and partely by the vnſacyable auaryce of ſuch as ſought more theyr own lucre, then the glory of God: that the abuſes coulde not well be taken away, the thyng remayning ſtyll. But nowe as concerning thoſe perſons, whyche peraduenture wyll bee offended, for that ſome
<pb facs="tcp:180822:5"/> of thold Ceremonies are reteyned ſtil: if they conſidre that without some Ceremonies, it is not possible to kepe any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, or quiet diſcipline in the church: they ſhall eaſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue iuſt cauſe to reforme their iudgementes. And if they thinke much, that any of thold doe remain, &amp; would rather haue all deuiſed a new: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch men graunting ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies conuenient to be had, ſurely where the olde may be wel vſed, there they cannot reaſonably reproue the olde, onely for their age, without bewraying of their owne foly. For in such a caſe, they ought rather to haue reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their antiquitie, yf they wyll declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be more ſtudious of vnitie &amp; concord, then of innouacions &amp; new fanglenes: whiche (aſmuche as may be with the true ſetting forth of Chriſtes religion) is alwayes to be eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Furthermore, ſuch ſhal haue no iuſt cauſe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies reſerued, to be offended. For as thoſe be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which were moſt abuſed, &amp; did burthen mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences without any cauſe: ſo the other that remayne, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned for a diſcipline and ordre, which (vpon iuſte cauſes) may be altered &amp; chaunged, &amp; therefore are not to be eſtemed equal with gods law. And moreouer, they be nether darke nor dombe Ceremonies: but are ſo ſet forth, that euery man may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they doe meane, and to what vſe they doe ſerue. So that it is not like that they in tyme to come, ſhould be abuſed as the other haue been. And in theſe oure doynges, we condemne no other nacions, nor preſcribe any thing, but to our own people onely. For we thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that euery countrey ſhould vſe ſuche Ceremonies, as they ſhall thynke beſt to the ſetting forth of Gods honoure or glory, and to the reducing of the people to a moſt perfecte and Godly liuing, without errour or ſuperſticion. And that they ſhould putte awaye other thynges whyche from tyme to tyme they perceiue to be moſt abuſed, as in mens ordinaunces it often chaunceth dyuerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in dyuerſe countreyes.</p>

But when his diſciples ſawe it, they had indignacion, ſaying: wherto ſerueth this waſte? This oyntment migtht haue been well ſolde, and geuen to the poore. When Ieſus vnderſtode that, he ſayd vnto them: why trouble ye the woman; for ſhe hath wrought a good worke vpon me. For ye haue the poore alwayes with you, but me ye ſhall not haue alwayes. And in that ſhe hathe caſte thys oyntmente on my body, ſhe did it to bury me. Verely I ſaye vnto you: whereſoeuer thys Goſpell ſhalbe preached in all the worlde, there ſhall alſo this be tolde that ſhe hathe done for a memoriall of her. Then one of the twelue (which was called Iudas Iſcarioth) went vnto the chiefe Prieſtes, and ſayd vnto them: what will ye geue me, and I wyll delyuer hym vnto you? And they appointed vnto him .xxx. pieces of ſyluer. And from that tyme forth, he ſoughte oportunitye to betraye hym. The firſte daye of ſwete bread, the diſciples came to Ieſus, ſaying to hym: where wylte thou that we prepare for thee, to eate the Paſſeouer? And he ſayde: Goe into the citie to ſuche a man, and ſaye vnto him: the Maſter ſayeth, my tyme is at hand, I wyll kepe my Eaſter by thee with my diſciples. And the diſciples did as Ieſus had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them, and they made readye the Paſſeouer. When the euen was come, he ſatte downe with the .xii. And as they dyd eate, he ſayde: Verely I ſay vnto you, that one of you ſhall betraye me. And they were excedyng ſorowful, and began euery one of them to ſaye vnto hym: Lorde is it I? He aunſwered and ſayde: he that dippeth hys hand with me in the diſſhe, theſame ſhall betraye me. The ſonne of manne truly goeth, as it is wrytten of hym: but woe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:180822:48"/> that man by whom the ſonne of man is betrayed. It had been good for that man, yf he had not been borne. Then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, which betrayed him, aunſwered, and ſayd: Maiſter, is it I? He ſayd vnto him: thou haſt ſaid. And when they were eatyng, Ieſus toke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it and gaue it to the diſciples, and ſayd: Take, eate, this is my body. And he toke the cup, and thanked, and gaue it them, ſaying: Drynke ye all of this: For this is my bloud (whiche is of the newe Teſtameant) that is ſhed for many, for the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes. But I ſay vnto you, I wil not drinke hencefurth of this fruite of the vine tree, vntil the day when I ſhal drinke it new with you in my fathers kingdom. And when they had ſayd grace, they went out vnto mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uete. Then ſayd Ieſus vnto them: all ye ſhalbe offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of me thys nighte. For it is wrytten: I wyll ſmyte the ſhepehearde, and the ſhepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcatterd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade: but after I am rieſen agayn, I wyll goe before you into Galile. Peter aunſwered, and ſayd vnto him: thoughe al men be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I not be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Ieſus ſayd vnto him: verely I ſaye vnto thee, that in thys ſame nyghte, before the Cocke krowe, thou ſhalte denye me thryſe. Peter ſayd vnto him: yea, though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not denye thee: likewyſe alſo ſayd all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Then came Ieſus with them vnto a farme place, (which is called Gethſemane) and ſayd vnto the diſciples. Sytte ye here, while I goe and praye yonder. And he tooke with him Peter, and the two ſonnes of zebede, and began to waxe ſorowful and heauy. Then ſayde Ieſus vnto them. My ſoule is heauy euen vnto the death. Tarye ye here and watche with me. And he wente a litle farther, and fell flat on his face, and prayed, ſaying: O my father, if it bee poſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this cup paſſe from me: neuerthleſſe, not as I wyll, but as thou wilt. And he came vnto the diſciples, and founde them aſlepe, and ſayd vnto Peter: what, could ye not watch with me one houre? watche and praye that ye enter not into temptacyon: the ſpirite is wyllyng, but the fleſhe is weake. He wente awaye once agayne and prayed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb facs="tcp:180822:49"/> O my father, yf this cuppe may not paſſe awaye from me except I drinke of it, thy wyll be fulfilled: and he came &amp; founde them aſlepe agayne, for theyr eyes were heauy. And he left them, and went agayne and praied the third time, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſame woordes. Then cometh he to his diſciples, and ſayde vnto them: ſlepe on now and take your reſt. Beholde, the houre is at hand, and the ſonne of man is betrayed into the handes of ſynners. Ryſe, let vs bee goyng: beholde, he is at hand that dooeth betraye me. Whyle he yet ſpake: loe, Iudas one of the noumbre of the .xii. came, and with hym a greate multitude with ſweordes and ſtaues, ſente from the chyefe Prieſtes and Elders of the people. But he that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed hym, gaue them a token, ſaying: whomeſocuer I kyſſe, the ſame is he, holde hym faſte. And forthwith he came to Ieſus, and ſayd: Hayle Maſter, and kyſſed hym. And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſayde vnto hym: frende, wherfore art thou come? Then came they and layde handes on Ieſus, and toke hym. And beholde, one of them that were with Ieſus, ſtretched out his hand and drewe his ſweorde, and ſtroke a ſeruaunt of the hye Prieſtes and ſmote of his eare. Then ſaid Ieſus vnto him: put vp thy ſweord into the ſheath, for all they that take the ſweord ſhall periſh with the ſweord. Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now praye to my father, and he ſhall geue me euen nowe, more then .xii. legions of Aungels? But howe then ſhall the ſcriptures bee fulfilled? For thus muſt it bee. In thatſame houre ſayde Ieſus to the multitude: ye bee come out as it were to a thefe with ſweordes and ſtaues, for to take me. I ſate daylye with you teaching in the temple, and ye toke me not. But all thys is done that the ſcriptures of the Prophetes myghte bee fulfylled. Then all the diſciples forſoke hym and fled. And they tooke Ieſus and led hym to Cayphas the hye Prieſte, where the Scribes and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were aſſembled. But Peter folowed hym afarre of vnto the hye Prieſtes palace, and wente in, and ſatte with the ſeruauntes to ſee the ende. The chiefe Prieſtes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all the counſell, ſought falſe witnes agaynſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (for to put hym to death) but founde none: yea, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:180822:49"/> falſe witneſſes came, yet founde they none. At the laſte came .ii. falſe wytneſſes, and ſaid: This felow ſayed, I am hable to deſtroye the temple of God, and to builde it agayne in three dayes. And the chiefe Prieſt; aroſe, and ſayd vnto hym: aunſwereſt thou nothing: Why doe theſe beare wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes agaynſt thee? but Ieſus helde his peace. And the chief Prieſt aunſwered, and ſayd vnto him. I charge thee by the liuing God, that thou tell vs, whether thou be Chryſte the ſonne of God. Ieſus ſayd vnto hym: thou haſt ſaid. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles I ſaye vnto you, hereafter ſhall ye ſee the ſonne of man ſytting on the ryghte hande of power, and commyng in the cloudes of the ſkye. Then the hie Prieſte rente hys clothes, ſaying: he hath ſpoken blaſphemye, what nede we of any more witneſſes? Beholde, nowe ye haue hearde hys blaſphemy, what thynke ye? They aunſwered, and ſayd: he is worthy to dye. Then did they ſpit in his face, and buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with fiſtes. And other ſmote hym on the face with the palme of theyr handes, ſaying: tell vs thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee? Peter ſate without in the courte, and a damoſell came to hym, ſaying: thou alſo waſte with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Galile: but he denied before them all, ſaying: I wote not what thou ſaiſt. When he was gone out into the porche, another wenche ſawe hym, and ſayed vnto them that were there: This felow was alſo with Ieſus of Nazareth. And againe he denyed with an othe, ſaying: I dooe not knowe the man. After a whyle came vnto him they that ſtode by, &amp; ſayed vnto Peter: ſurely thou art euen one of them, for thy ſpeache bewraieth the. Then began he to curſe &amp; to ſweare, that he knew not the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And immediatly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cocke krew. And Peter remembred the worde of Ieſu, which ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym: before the cocke krowe, thou ſhalt denye me thriſe: and he wente oute and wepte bitterly. When the mornyng was come, all the chiefe Prieſtes and Elders of the people helde a counſell agaynſte Ieſus, to put hym to death, and broughte hym bounde, and delyuered hym vnto Poncyus Pilate the deputie. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudas (which had betrayed hym) ſeeyng that he was condemned, repented hymſelfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:180822:50"/> brought agayne the .xxx. plates of ſiluer to the chief prieſtes and Elders, ſayng: I haue ſinned betraying the innocente bloud. And they ſayd: what is that to vs? Se thou to that. And he caſte downe the ſiluer plates in the temple, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went and hanged himſelf. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief Prieſtes toke the ſiluer plates, and ſayd: It is not lawful for to put them into the treaſure, becauſe it is the price of bloud. And they toke counſayle, and bought with them a potters fielde to bury ſtraungers in. Wherefore the fielde is called Hacel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema, that is, the field of bloud, vntyll thys day. Then was fulfylled that whiche was ſpoken by Ieremie the prophete, ſaying: and they tooke .xxx. ſyluer plates, the pryce of hym that was valued, whom they boughte of the chyldren of Iſrael, and gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lorde appointed me. Ieſus ſtode before the deputie, and the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aſked hym, ſaying: Art thou the king of the Iewes? Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſayed vnto hym: thou ſayeſt. And when he was accuſed of the chief prieſtes and elders, he aunſwered nothing. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid pilate vnto him: heareſt thou not how many witneſſes they lai againſt thee? &amp; he aunſwered him to neuer a word: inſomuch that the deputie merueiled greatly. At that feaſt, the deputie was wont to deliuer vnto the people a priſoner whom they woulde deſyre. He had then a notable pryſoner called Barrabas. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Pilate ſayed: whether will ye that I geue looce vnto you, Barrabas, or Ieſus whiche is called Chriſte &amp; For he knew that for enuy they had deliuered him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſet down to geue iudgement, his wyfe ſente vnto hym, ſaying: haue thou nothyng to doe with that iuſte man. For I haue ſuffred thys day many thynges in my ſlepe, becauſe of hym. But the chief prieſtes and elders perſwaded the people that they ſhould aſke Barrabas, and deſtroy Ieſus. The depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aunſwered, and ſayd vnto them: whether of the twayne wil ye that I let looce vnto you? They ſaid, Barrabas. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what ſhal I doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Ieſus, whiche is called Chriſt? They al ſayd vnto hym: let him be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The deputie ſayd: what euil hath he done? but they cried
<pb facs="tcp:180822:50"/> more ſaying, let him be crucified. When Pilate ſaw that he could preuayle nothing, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more buſines was made: he toke water, &amp; waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt perſon, ſee ye. Then aunſwered al the people, and ſayd: hys bloud be on vs &amp; on our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let he Barrabas loce vnto them &amp; ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ieſus, &amp; deliuered him to be crucified. Then the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the deputie toke Ieſus into the common hall, and gathered vnto him al the company, and thei ſtripped him, &amp; put on him a purple robe, &amp; platted a crowne of thornes, &amp; put it vpon his head, &amp; a rede in his right hand, and vowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying: hayle king of the Iewes: and when they had ſpit vpon him, they toke the rede &amp; ſmote him on the head. And after that they had moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, thei toke the robe of him again, &amp; put his own rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, &amp; led hym a way to crucifye hym. And as they came out, they found a man of Cirene (named Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) hym they compelled to beare his croſſe. And they came vnto the place which is called Golgotha, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is to ſay (a place of dead mens ſculles) and gaue him vinegre myngled with gall to drinke: &amp; when he had taſted thereof, he woulde not drinke. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had crucified him, they parted his garmentes &amp; did caſt lottes, that it myght be fulfilled which was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Prophete. They parted my garmentes among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vpon my beſture did they caſt lottes. And they ſate and watched him there, &amp; ſet vp ouer hys head the cauſe of hys death written. This is Ieſus the king of the Iewes. Then were there two theues crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. They that paſſed by, reuyled him, wagging their heades, &amp; ſaying: thou that deſtroyedſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of god, &amp; didſt build it in three daies, ſaue thy ſelf. If thou be the ſonne of god come down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo the hye Prieſtes mocking him with the Scribes and Elders, ſayd: he ſaued other, himſelf he cannot ſaue. If he bee the Kyng of Iſraell, lette hym nowe come downe from the croſſe, and we will belieue hym. He truſted in GOD, lette hym delyuer hym nowe, yf he wyll haue
<pb facs="tcp:180822:51"/> him: for he ſayd, I am the ſonne of God. The theues alſo whiche were crucifyed with him, caſt theſame in his teeth. From the ſixth houre was there darkenes ouer al the land vntyll the ninth houre. And aboute the ninth houre, Ieſus cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying: Ely, Ely, lamaſabathany: that is to ſay, my god my god, why haſt thou forſaken me? Some of them that ſtode there, when they heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, ſayde: This man calleth for Helyas. And ſtreyghte waye one of them ranne and toke a ſponge, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had filled it full of vineger, he put it on a rede, and gaue him to drynke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayde: let be, let vs ſee whether Helyas will come and deliuer him. Ieſus when he had cryed agayn with a loude voyce, yelded vp the goſt. And behold, the vayle of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dyd rent in .ii. partes, from the top to the bottome, and the earth did quake, and the ſtones rent, and graues did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and many bodies of Sainctes whiche ſlept, aroſe and wente out of the graues after hys reſurrection, and came into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many. When the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turion, and they that were with him watching Ieſus, ſaw the earthquake, and thoſe thinges whiche happened, they feared greatly, ſaying: Truely this was the ſonne of god. And many weomen were there (beholdyng hym afarre of) which folowed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto hym: Emong which was Mary Magdalene, &amp; Mary the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iames &amp; Ioſes, and the mother of zebedes childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

And Ieſus ſaith vnto them: all ye ſhalbe offended becausſe of me this nyghte, For it is wrytten: I wyll ſmyte the ſhepeheard, &amp; the ſhepe ſhalbe ſcattered: but after that I am ryſen agayne, I wyll goe into Galile before you. Peter ſaid vnto hym: and though all men bee offended, yet wyll not I. And Ieſus ſayeth vnto hym: verely I ſay vnto thee, that this day, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this night, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cocke krow twiſe thou ſhalte denye me thre times, But he ſpake more vehementelye: no, yf I ſhoulde dye with

And thei came into a place which was named Gethſemane, and he ſayd to hys diſciples: ſytte ye here whyle I goe aſyde &amp; pray. And he taketh with him, Peter and Iames, &amp; Iohn, And beganne to waxe abaſhed and to be in an agony, &amp; ſayd vnto them: My ſoule is heauy euen vnto the death: tary ye here and watche. And he went furth a little, and fell downe flat on the ground and praied, that if it wer poſſible, the houre might paſſe from hym. And he ſayd: Abba father, all thinges are poſſible vnto thee, take away thys cup fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, not as I wil, but that thou wylt be done. And he came and founde them ſlepyng, and ſayeth to Peter: Symon, ſlepeſt thou? Couldeſt not thou watche one houre? watche ye &amp; pray leſt ye entre into temptacyon: the ſpirite truly is ready, but the fleſhe is weake. And agayne he wente aſyde &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpake the ſame wordes. And he returned &amp; found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſlepe agayne, for theyr &amp; eyes were heauy, neyther wyſt they what to aunſwere hym. And he came the thyrde tyme and ſayde vnto them: ſlepe hencefurth and take youre eaſe, it is inough. The houre is come: beholde, the ſonne of man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the handes of ſinners: Ryſe vp, let vs goe. Loe, he that betrayeth me is at hand. And immedyathly whyle he yet ſpake, cometh Iudas (whyche was one of the twelue) &amp; with hym a greate noumber of people with ſweordes and ſtaues, from the hie prieſtes, and Scribes, and Elders. And he that betrayed him, had geuen them a generall token, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whoſoeuer I doe kiſſe, the ſame is he: take and leade him away warely. And aſſone as he was come, he goeth ſtraight waye to him, and ſayeth vnto hym: Maſter, Maſter, and kyſſed hym: and they layed theyr handes on hym, and tooke hym. And one of them that ſtoode by, drewe oute a ſweorde, and ſmote a ſeruaunte of the hye Prieſtes, and cutte of hys eare. And Ieſus aunſwered and ſayd vnto them: ye be come oute as vnto a thefe with ſweordes and ſtaues, for to take me. I was dayly with you in the temple teachyng, and ye took me not: but theſe thynges come to paſſe that the Scripture ſhoulde bee fulfylled. And they all forſoke
<pb facs="tcp:180822:53"/> him, and ran away. And there folowed him a certayn yong man clothed in linnen vpon the bare: and the yong menne caught hym, and he left hys linnen garment, and fled from them naked. And they led Ieſus awaye to the high prieſt of all, and with him came all the hye prieſtes, and the Elders, &amp; the Scribes. And Peter folowed hym a great way of (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen till he was come into the palace of the hie Prieſt) and he ſate with the ſeruauntes, and warmed himſelfe at the fyre. And the hye prieſtes and al the counſell ſought for witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte Ieſu to put him to death, and found none: for many bare falſe witnes agaynſte hym, but theyr witneſſes agreed not together. And there aroſe certayne and broughte falſe witnes agaynſte hym, ſaying: we hearde hym ſaye, I wyll deſtroye this temple that is made with handes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three dayes, I will build another made without handes. But yet theyr witneſſes agreed not together. And the hye Prieſte ſtoode vp among them, and aſked Ieſus, ſaying: aunſwereſt thou nothyng? Howe is it that theſe beare wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes agaynſte thee? But he helde hys peace, and aunſwered nothyng. Agayne the hye Prieſt aſked hym, and ſayde vnto hym: Arte thou Chriſte the ſonne of the bleſſed? And Ieſus ſayd: I am. And ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man ſittyng on the ryght hand of power, and comyng in the cloudes of heauen. Then the hye Prieſt rent hys clothes, and ſayde: what nede we any further of witneſſes? ye haue heard blaſphemy, what thynke ye? And they all condemned hym to bee woorthye of deathe. And ſome beganne to ſpyt at hym, and to couer hys face, and to beate hym with fiſtes, and to ſaye vnto hym: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reade. And the ſeruauntes buffeted hym on the face. And as Peter was beneathe in the Palace, there came one of the wenches of the hieſt prieſte: and when ſhe ſawe Peter war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng himſelf, ſhe loked on hym, and ſayd: waſt not thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with Ieſus of Nazareth? And he denied, ſaying: I know him not, nether wote I what thou ſayeſt. And he went oute into the porche, and the Cocke krewe. And a damoſel (when ſhe ſawe him) began agayne to ſay to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſtode by: this is one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And he denyed it agayn.

But he began to curſe and to ſweare, ſaying: I knowe not thys man of whom ye ſpeake. And again the cocke krewe, and Peter remembred the woorde that Ieſus had ſayde vnto him: before the cocke krow twiſe, thou ſhalte denye me three times. And he began to wepe.</p>

Then Ieſus ſayde vnto the hye pryeſtes, and rulers of the temple, and the elders, whyche were come to hym: Ye bee come out as vnto a thefe, with ſweordes and ſtaues. When I was dayly with in the Temple, ye ſtretched foorthe no handes againſte me: but this is euen your verye houre, &amp; the power of darkenes. Then toke they hym and ledde him, and brought him to the hie prieſtes houſe. But Peter folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afarre of.

<pb facs="tcp:180822:57"/> after, another affyrmed, ſaying: verely thys felowe was with him alſo, for he is of Galile. And Peter ſayed: man, I wote not what thou ſayeſt. And immediately while he yet ſpake, the Cocke krewe. And the lord turned backe and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon Peter. And Peter remembred the woorde of the Lord, how he had ſayd vnto hym: before the Cocke krowe, thou ſhalt denie me thriſe: and Peter went out &amp; wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. And the men that tooke Ieſus, mocked him, &amp; ſmote him: and when they had blindfolded him, thei ſtroke him on the face, and aſked him, ſaying: Areade, who is he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmote thee? And many other thinges deſpitefully ſaid they againſt hym. And as ſoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, and the hie Prieſtes and Scribes, came together, and led hym, into theyr counſel, ſaying: Art thou very Chriſt? tel vs. And he ſaid vnto them: If I tell you, ye wil not beleue me: &amp; if I aſke you, you will not aunſwere, nor let me goe: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall the ſonne of man ſit on the right hand of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God.

For firſt of all, when ye come together in the congregacion, I heare that there is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencyon among you, and I partlye beeleue it. For there muſte bee ſectes among you, that thei which are perfecte among you, may be knowen. When ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore into one place, the Lordes ſupper cannot bee eaten, for euerye manne beginneth afore to eate his owne ſupper. And one is hungrye, and another is dronken. Haue ye not houſes to eate and drinke in? deſpiſe ye the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacyon of God, and ſhame them that haue not? what ſhall I ſay vnto you? ſhall I prayſe you? In thys I prayſe
<pb facs="tcp:180822:58"/> you not. That whyche I deliuered vnto you, I receiued of the lord. For the lord Ieſus, theſame night in which he was betrayed, tooke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it, and ſaid. Take ye and eate, this is my body which is broken for you. This doe ye in the remembraunce of me. After theſame maner alſo, he tooke the cuppe when ſupper was done, ſaying: this cuppe is the new Teſtament in my bloud. This doe, as oft as ye drinke it in remembraunce of me. For as often as ye ſhall eate this bread, &amp; drinke of this cup, ye ſhal ſhewe the Lordes death til he come. Wherefore, whoſoeuer ſhal eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup of the lorde vnworthely, ſhalbe giltie of the body and bloud of the lord. But let a man examine himſelfe, &amp; ſo let hym eate of the bread and drinke of the cuppe. For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lordes bodye. For this cauſe many are weake and ſicke among you, and many ſlepe. For if we had iudged our ſelues, we ſhoulde not haue been iudged. But when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are chaſtened, that we ſhould not bee damned with the worlde. Wherefore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for another. If any man hungre, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condemnacyon. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges wyl I ſet ordre when I come.</p>

Pilate then went out to them, and ſayde: what accuſacion bryng you agaynſt thys man? They aunſwered, and ſayde vnto hym. Yf he were not an euyll doer, we woulde not haue delyuered hym vnto thee. Then ſayde Pilate vnto them: take ye him and iudge hym after your owne lawe. The Iewes therefore ſayde vnto hym: It is not lawefull for vs to putte anye man to death, that the woordes of Ieſus myghte bee fulfylled, whiche he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhoulde dye. Then Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late entred into the iudgemente hall agayn, and called Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſayde vnto hym. Art thou the kyng of the Iewes? Ieſus aunſwered: ſayeſt thou that of thy ſelfe, or dyd other tell it thee of me? Pilate aunſwered: Am I a Iewe? Thine own nacion and hye prieſtes haue deliuered thee vnto me: what haſt thou doone? Ieſus aunſwered: my kyngdome is not of thys worlde: if my kyngdome were of thys worlde, then woulde my miniſters ſurelye fyghte, that I ſhoulde not bee deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence. Pilate therfore ſayde vnto hym: Arte thou a Kyng then? Ieſus aunſwered: thou ſayeſt that I am a kyng. For this cauſe was I borne, &amp; for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould beare witnes vnto the truth. And all that are of the trueth, heare my voyce. Pilate ſayd vnto him: what thing is truth? And when he had ſayd this, he went out agayn vnto the Iewes, and ſayeth vnto them: I fynde in hym no cauſe at all. Ye haue a cuſtome that I ſhould deliuer you one looce at Eaſter: will ye that I looce vnto you the king of the Iewes? Then cried they al again, ſaying: Not him, but Barrabas, theſame Barrabas was a murtherer. Then Pilate toke Ieſus therefore, &amp; ſcourged him. And the ſoudiours wounde a crowne of thornes,
<pb facs="tcp:180822:62"/> and putte it on his head. And they did on him a purple gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and came vnto him, &amp; ſaid: Hayl king of the Iewes, and they ſmote him on the face. Pilate went furth agayn, and ſayde vnto them: beholde, I bryng him foorth to you, that ye maye know that I find no faulte in him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came Ieſus foorthe wearyng a crowne of thorne, and a robe of purple. And he ſaith vnto them: behold the man. When the Prieſtes therfore and the miniſters ſawe hym, they cryed, Crucifye him, Crucifye him. Pylate ſaieth vnto them: take ye hym and Crucifye hym, for I fynde no cauſe in hym. The Iewes aunſwered him: we haue a lawe, and by oure lawe he oughte to dye, becauſe he made hymſelfe the ſonne of GOD. When Pylate hearde that ſaying, he was the more afraid, and went againe into the iudgement hall, and ſayde vnto Ieſus: whence art thou? But Ieſus gaue hym none aunſwere. Then ſayde Pylate vnto hym. Speakeſt thou not vnto me? knoweſt thou not that I haue power to crucifye thee, &amp; haue power to looce thee? Ieſus au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered: Thou couldeſt haue no power at all agaynſt me, excepte it wer geuen thee from aboue: Therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the more ſinne. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thenceforth ſought Pilate meanes to looce hym: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou let him goe, thou art not Ceaſars frend: for whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer maketh himſelfe a kyng, is agaynſt Ceaſar. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late heard that ſaying, he brought Ieſus furth, &amp; ſat down to geue ſentence in a place y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is called the pauement, but in the Hebrue tongue, Gabbatha. It was the preparyng day of Eaſter, aboute the ſixth houre. And he ſayeth vnto the Iewes: behold your kyng. They cryed, ſaying: away with him, away with him, crucifye him. Pylate ſayth vnto them: ſhal I crucifye your king? The hye Prieſtes aunſwered: we haue no king but Ceaſar. Then deliuered he him to them to be crucifyed. And they toke Ieſus and led hym awaye, and he bare his croſſe, and wente foorth into a place whiche is called the place of dead mens ſculles: but in Hebrue Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha: where they crucifyed him, and two other with him, on eyther ſyde one, and Ieſus in the myddeſt. And Pylate
<pb facs="tcp:180822:62"/> wrote a tytle and put it vpon the croſſe. The writyng was, Ieſus of Nazareth kyng of the Iewes. Thys tytle readde many of the Iewes: for the place where Ieſus was crucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, was here to the citie. And it was written in Hebrue, Greke, and Latin. Then ſayd the hye prieſtes of the Iewes to Pilate: write not kyng of the Iewes, but that he ſayde: I am kyng of the Iewes. Pilate aunſwered: what I haue written that I haue written. Then the ſouldiers, when they had crucifyed Ieſus, took hys garmentes, and made foure partes, to euery ſoudier a parte, and alſo hys coate. The coate was withoute ſeame, wroughte vpon throughoute. They ſayde therfore among themſelues: lte vs not deuide it, but caſt lottes for it who ſhall haue it, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture might be fulfylled, ſaying: They haue parted my raymente among them, and for my coate did they caſt lottes. And the ſouldiers dyd ſuche thynges in dede. There ſtode by the croſſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, hys mother, and hys mothers ſiſter, Mary the wyfe of Cleophas, and Marye Magdalene. When Ieſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple, whom he loued, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, he ſayth vnto his mother: woman, behold thy ſonne. Then ſaid he to the diſciple: beholde thy mother. And from that houre the diſciple toke her for hys owne.</p>
                              <p>After theſe thynges, Ieſus knowyng that all thynges were nowe performed, that the ſcripture might bee fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ſayeth: I thyrſte. So there ſtoode a veſſell by full of vynegre: therefore they fylled a ſponge with vinegre, and wounde it aboute with Iſope, and put it to his mouthe. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as Ieſus then receyued of the vynegre, he ſayd: It is fyniſhed, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghoſte. The Iewes therefore, becauſe it was the preparyng of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bothe, that the bodies ſhould not remayne vpon the Croſſe on the Sabboth daye (for that Sabboth daye, was an hye daye) beſoughte Pilate that theyr legges myghte bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that they mighte bee taken downe. Then came the ſouldiers and brake the legges of the fyrſt, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſawe that he was dead already, they brake not hys
<pb facs="tcp:180822:63"/> legges: but one of the ſouldiours with a ſpeare thruſte hym into the ſyde, and forthwith there came out bloud &amp; water. And he that ſawe it bare record, and his record is true. And he knoweth that he ſayeth true, that ye myght beleue alſo. For theſe thynges were done that the ſcripture ſhoulde bee fulfylled: ye ſhall not breake a bone of hym.</p>
                              <p>And agayne another ſcripture ſayeth: they ſhal loke vpon him whom they haue pearſed. After this, Ioſeph of Arama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia (whych was a diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretely for feare of the Iewes) beſought Pilate that he might take downe the body of Ieſus. And Pilate gaue him licence. He came therfore &amp; toke the body of Ieſus. And there came alſo Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus (which at the beginning came to Ieſus by night) and brought of Myrre and Aloes mingled together, aboute an hundreth pounde weight. Then toke they the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and wounde it in linnen clothes with the Odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burye. And in the place where he was crucifyed, there was a garden, and in the garden a newe Sepulchre wherein was neuer man layde: There layde they Ieſus therefore becauſe of the preparing of the Sabbothe of the Iewes, for the Sepulchre was nye at hande.</p>

                              <p>They angred Moſes alſo in the tentes: and Aaron the ſainct of the Lorde.</p>
                              <p>So the earth opened and ſwalowed vp Dathan: and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the congregacion of Abiram.</p>
                              <p>And the fier was kiendled in their companye: the flame brent vp the vngodly.</p>
                              <p>They made a calfe in Horeb: and worſhipped the molten ymage.</p>
                              <p>Thus they turned their glory into the ſimilitude of a calf: that eateth haye.</p>

                              <p>Yea, they thought ſcorne of that pleaſaunt land: and gaue no credence vnto hys worde.</p>
                              <p>But murmured in their tentes: and harkened not vnto the voyce of the Lorde.</p>
                              <p>Then lift he vp his hand againſt them: to ouerthrow them in the wildernes.</p>

                              <p>They angred hym alſo at the waters of ſtryfe: ſo that he puniſhed Moſes for theyr ſakes.</p>
